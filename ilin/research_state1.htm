    I am interested in the fields of applied Operations Research and design &amp; 
    analysis of algorithms. I have an undergraduate major in <a href="http://www.iaa.ncku.edu.tw">Aerospace 
    Engineering</a>, and since 1994 I have studied Operations Research at several 
    of the best institutes in the <st1:country-region>U.S.</st1:country-region> 
    I have learned linear programming, nonlinear programming, network optimization, 
    and algorithms from the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/orc/www">OR center</a> 
    at <a href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a>; stochastic processes and simulation 
    from <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/MSandE">MSE</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford 
    University</a>; and integer programming, combinatorial optimization and graph 
    theory from <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu">ISyE</a>, <st1:country-region><a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia</a></st1:country-region><a href="http://www.gatech.edu"> 
    Tech</a>.&nbsp; In other words, I am well trained by the best schools in their 
    strongest fields.&nbsp; Also, I am confident in my ability to face new challenges 
    in new environments.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network optimization and algorithm 
    design are the fields that I have devoted most of my research efforts to. 
    My Master's thesis, &quot;<i><a href="file:///D:/Backup/html/ilin/tothesis.html">Implementing 
    the Premultiplier Method for Minimum Cost Flow Problem</a></i>&quot;, was 
    the first implementation of a new polynomial time network simplex algorithm 
    proposed by <a href="http://www.mit.edu/%7Ejorlin/">Dr. James B. Orlin</a> 
    of MIT. Subsequently, the communication network system research lab of <a href="http://www.labs.fujitsu.com/en">Fujitsu 
    Research Lab</a> in <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region> gave me 
    a position as a foreign researcher to work on their telecommunication project. 
    I proposed and implemented several wavelength assignment and routing algorithms 
    (later known as <a href="http://magazine.fujitsu.com/us/vol35-1/paper09.pdf">FINDEM</a>, 
    the Fujitsu Integrated Network Design Method) for their WDM management prototype. 
    At Georgia Tech, my Ph.D. dissertation, &quot;<i><a href="./phdthesis/index.html">Shortest 
    Paths and Multicommodity Network Flows</a></i>&quot;, gives several new multiple 
    pairs shortest path algorithms and proposes new multicommodity network flow 
    algorithms. My new shortest path algorithms are the first in five decades 
    designed specifically for finding shortest paths for multiple origin-destination 
    (OD) pairs. Overall, these experiences show my potential as a strong researcher 
    who is able to independently propose new ideas, even for old subjects.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With my strong OR background and solid programming skills, there is a wide range 
    of theoretical and applied research that I can investigate. In particular, 
    I am interested in the following topics:</p>
  <br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
  <li><b>Supply 
    Chain Logistics:</b></li>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many logistics problems are network optimization problems. For example, routing 
    problems for products, vehicles, or personnel; traffic assignment and equilibrium 
    problems; product scheduling and planning problems; and freight network design 
    problems are usually variants of multicommodity network flow problems. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked in the <a href="http://www.aidc.com.tw/aidc/power/main/power2.htm">Integrated 
    Logistics Support (ILS) group</a> of <a href="http://www.aidc.com.tw">Aero-Industry- 
    Development-Center (AIDC)</a> in 1991~1993 for two years on logistics problems 
    relating to aircraft parts. Since 2000, I have been involved in the Air Cargo 
    project of <a href="http://tli.isye.gatech.edu">The Logistics Institute (TLI)</a> 
    in my department and <a href="http://www.tliap.nus.edu.sg">TLI-Asia-Pacific 
    (TLI-AP)</a> at the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">National University of 
    Singapore</a>. Having studied the cargo terminal of Changi airport, I am familiar 
    with the logistics problems that such terminals face. Currently TLI-AP has 
    several joint research projects with my advisor, <a href="http://www..gatech.edu/people/faculty/Ellis_Johnson/">Dr. 
    Ellis Johnson</a>, a pioneering researcher in the fields of airline operations 
    research such as crew scheduling, fleet assignment, and revenue management. 
    I am, and will continue to be, involved in their research of Air Cargo network 
    problems as proposed in our TLI-AP white paper, &iexcl;&sect;<i><a href="http://www.tliap.nus.edu.sg/TliapOpeningWebsite/research/white_papers_document/Air-Cargo-Report-16012001.pdf">The 
    Asia Pacific Air Cargo System</a></i>би.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My connection to TLI-AP and TLI may be helpful in future collaborations to solve 
    logistics problems in <st1:country-region>Taiwan</st1:country-region>.</p>
    <li><b>Telecommunication 
    Networks:</b></li>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message routing between many OD pairs, packet routing on virtual circuit data 
    networks, routing on ring networks, and many telecommunication network design 
    problems can be formulated as multicommodity network flow problems, which 
    is a major topic of my Ph.D. thesis.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my previous experience and connection to the people in Fujitsu Research 
    Lab., possible joint research opportunities may be identified in internet 
    related fields.</p>
  <li><b>Bioengineering and 
    Bioinformatics:</b></li>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bio-related research is currently a hot topic. Many biological questions are, 
    in fact, optimization problems and can be solved with success by operations 
    research techniques such as integer programming and combinatorial optimization 
    algorithms. For example, gene expression array analysis, sequence comparisons, 
    gene finding and prediction, and structure prediction all can be modeled as 
    optimization problems.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some biomedical problems such as cancer treatment planning and 
    radio surgery for tumors can be formulated as mixed integer programming problems 
    and solved by OR techniques.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My department, ISyE at Georgia Tech, has several researchers working on these 
    problems. To the best of my knowledge, I have not seen much work done in these 
    fields in <st1:country-region>Taiwan</st1:country-region>. With my OR training 
    and connection to the faculty of ISyE, I am able to investigate this new research 
    right away.</p>
  <li><b>Research in Optimization 
    Techniques:</b></li>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested in the last chapter of my Ph.D. thesis, there is potential for 
    innovative research in shortest path algorithms and multicommodity network 
    flow algorithms. Research regarding new methods such as the primal-dual least 
    squares method for solving linear programming problems is also a promising 
    research topic to investigate. Since I have been working on these problems 
    for a few years, I am familiar with many state-of-the-art optimization techniques 
    and am ready for further research on these topics.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By proposing research projects that involve not only myself but also colleagues 
    and students in this department, I hope that my knowledge, capability, personality 
    and connection to other people and institutes in Singapore, Japan, and USA 
    can make a positive contribution to the students and faculty of this department 
    and this school.</p>
