<P><B>Introduction</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>current work on lightwave network architectures has largely been based
on </LI>

<P>(a) using fixed passive power combiners in a broadcast mode <BR>
(b) using point to point optical links with electronic switching and multiplexing
</P>

<LI>all operations on signals within the network are performed optically.
Thus, unlike (b) above, it contains no &quot;electronic bottlenecks&quot;;
as opposed to the star network in (a), the LLN can have any arbitrary mesh
type topology thus achieving greater reliability and better load distribution
</LI>

<LI>the network is assumed to operate in a circuit-switched mode at the
optical level </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><B>Structure and Properties of the LLN</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>the heart of the LLN is a LDC(linear divider-combiner) present at each
node. Its function is to direct prescribed combinations of the inbound
signals at the node to each outbound fiber in a controllable fashion. </LI>

<LI>the <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>'s can be set to other values between
0 and 1 to achieve power multiplexing and splitting. More general LDCs
could have wavelength selectivity built into the control parameters <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><SUB>i</SUB>
and thus act as controllable filters. However, this work is confined to
LDCs without wavelength selectivity. </LI>

<LI>Larger LDCs with more input and output fibers can be built, which are
capable of directing a portion of the power from each input link to any
output link.This paper assumes such devices are located at each network
node. </LI>

<LI>While some power attenuation occurs in traversing each LDC and each
fiber, it is assumed that signal levels at all receivers are maintained
sufficiently high(by optical amplification if necessary) for satisfactory
reception. </LI>

<LI>Assume: there is a network manager and a signaling system that sets
up calls on request from the user stations, by establishing end-to-end(circuit
switched) optical paths between transmitter and receiver. </LI>

<LI>this paper only considers point-to-point connection for the simplicity
although multicast connections are easily handled in LLNs. </LI>

<LI>The network manager determines the physical path to be allocated to
the call, sets the respective LDC parameters(like a's) along the route
and finally assigns physical route allocated to the call. The physical
route allocated to the call is assumed to remain unchanged throughout its
duration. </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><B>Constraints of the LLN</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>LLN has the following properties: </LI>

<P>(a)each signal is transported optically in unmodified form from transmitter
to receiver(i.e. there is no frequency conversion, regeneration, buffering
or any other non-linear operation within the network)<BR>
(b)more than 1 signal may be combined(linearly) on each link(fiber). these
are termed &quot;interfering&quot; signals. <BR>
(c)a MA(multiple access) scheme is implemented allowing for the signals
interfering on any link to be distinguishable at the receivers. A typical
channelization technique is WDMA, wherein the optical spectrum is subdivided
into a no. of non-overlapping wavelength channels. </P>

<LI>The structure of the LLN imposes some special constraints on the routing
problem: </LI>

<P><B>(a)Channel Continuity: <BR>
</B>a call must be allocated the same channel(wavelength) on all the links
that it traverses within the network <BR>
<B>(b)Distinct Channel Assignment: <BR>
</B>all interfering calls must be assigned distinct channels <BR>
the same wavelength could be reused by calls using disjoint paths <BR>
<B>(c)Inseparability: <BR>
</B>signals combined on a single fiber cannot be separated within the LLN
<BR>
This is because LDC operate on the aggregate power carried on each inbound
link without distinguishing between signals on different channels. <BR>
inseparability tends to create unintended multicast connections where point-to-point
connections were intended. This is inevitable, and may waste both power
and bandwidth. <BR>
<B>(d)Mutually Independent Sources Combining(MISC) <BR>
</B>only signals from mutually independent sources may be combined on the
same fiber.i.e. a signal is not allowed to split taking multiple paths
in the network and then recombine on a link. If a routing violates this
condition, it will result in a source interfering with itself. <BR>
<B>(e)Color Clash: <BR>
</B>a color clash arises when a routing decision on a new call results
in combining on the same fiber 2 or more calls, already in progress(on
disjoint paths) which were previously assigned to the same channel. </P>

<LI>This paper will address 2 channel assignment policies: <BR>
(1)one in which retuning of sources is permitted <BR>
(2)the other which precludes retuning of calls already in progress <BR>
However, the MISC condition violations cannot be avoided by a retuning
of sources. </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><B>Routing</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>routing involves </LI>

<P>(a)choosing a path for a requested call <BR>
(b)checking for violations of the LLN constraints <BR>
(c)assigning an appropriate channel to the call </P>

<LI>this paper only deal with point-to-point connections. the problem can
be divided into 3 parts </LI>

<P>(1)physical path allocation <BR>
the algorithm using here is to find K shortest s-d paths. 2 variants: </P>
</OL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Case1</B>: No Retuning of Sources Permitted <BR>
using meaningful link cost assignment, we choose the one among the K-paths
which interferes with the least no. of other sources, without violating
the MISC and Color Clash conditions. <BR>
if none of the K shortest paths satisfies the constraints, the call is
blocked. <BR>
if K=1=&gt;the physical path allocated to the call is the shortest path
<BR>
<BR>
disadvantage of using shortest path routing: <BR>
(i)it ignores the detrimental effects of inseparability <BR>
(ii)it does not take into account the power losses within the nodes. <BR>
(i)(ii) can be overcome by considering K&gt;=2. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Case2</B>: Retuning of Source Permitted <BR>
same as Case1 except ignoring the Color Clash constraint violation. </LI>
</UL>

<P>(2)checking for an MISC violation </P>

<P>As the call moves from link to link on its paths(both intended and unintended)
it carries along with it all the signals with which it has combined on
previous links. The algorithm checks to see if any of the signals carried
along in this fashion violates the MISC condition. </P>

<P>For example, if we are checking the MISC condition violation for signal
S<SUB>1</SUB> </P>

<P>(3)channel allocation </P>

<P>once a physical path is selected for a new call, the complete set of
paths(both intended and unintended) is obtained as a by product of the
MISC condition checking algorithm. </P>

<P>2 channel assignment policies: </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Case1</B>: No Retuning of Sources Permitted <BR>
the channels that have already been assigned to calls in progress remain
fixed. <BR>
channels that are already in use on links can not be assigned to the incoming
call <BR>
2 heuristics for channel assignment: </LI>

<P>(a)MAX heuristic: <BR>
among all the remaining usable channels, assign the most used one to call.
<BR>
it's because we want to reuse each channel as much as possible. </P>

<P>(b)MIN heuristic: <BR>
assign the call on the least used of all the remaining usable channels
<BR>
this heuristic tends to distribute the calls evenly among the channels
</P>

<LI><B>Case2</B>: Retuning of Sources Permitted <BR>
calls already in progress may be retuned to new channels when a new call
is accepted. So, we have to buffer the information carried by these calls
at the source for the period that the retuning is taking place. Because
we are retuning the sources, the Color Clash violations can be avoid. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The problem of assigning or reassigning channels to calls is shown to
be NP-Complete. So, they don't invest this case. </P>

<P><B>Abstract</B>: </P>

<OL>
<LI>This paper is based on the previous paper. The only difference is in
the process of physical path allocation. </LI>

<LI>It is shown that the problem of funding a physical path that does not
violate the MISC constraint of the LLN is NP-complete. </LI>

<LI>They use an algorithm called BLOW-UP for the physical path allocation
to set up an incoming call along a path that minimizes the maximum incremental
interference under certain conditions. </LI>

<LI>they use the same algorithms to check for MISC and Color Clash conflicts
as previous paper. They only use the MIN heuristic to allocate calls to
the channels which are the least used. </LI>

<LI>Comparing to the equivalent STAR based network, it has a significant
reduction in blocking probability. Furthermore, the BLOW-UP algorithm shows
better performance than other algorithms explored in previous paper. </LI>

<OL>
<LI>Thus, they seek a path which has a good chance to satisfy both MISC
and Color Clash constraints by choosing a physical path for each incoming
call that has the &quot;least&quot; amount of interference with other calls
already in progress. The define an &quot;image&quot; network as follows:
</LI>

<LI>Image network: each node in the network is &quot;blow up&quot; to create
additional intranodal links between each input/output pair. </LI>
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>Referring to the Fig6 &amp; 7, within each node, we create an internal
node for each inbound link and each outbound link. Add intranodal links
between each of these internal nodes directed from the inbound links to
the outbound links. </LI>

<LI>For each intranodal link i-j, let G<SUB>j</SUB> represents the set

where M&gt;sum of cost of all non-intranodal links.; Let each non-intranodal
link has cost 1. </LI>

<LI>Similar simulator in previous paper is built here. They tested for

<LI>A STAR network built for comparing with the LLN is a 30 terminal network
with 6 channels, and each terminal is modeled by a 2 state Markov chain
as above. The blocking probability for this case is the same as that of
a circuit switch having 30 inputs and 6 outputs and can be obtained using
the formula for the Engset distribution with parameter <FONT FACE="Symbol">l/m</FONT>.
</LI>

<LI>From their result, the BLOW-UP algorithm performed slightly better
than K-SP algorithm in previous paper. </LI>

<LI>It is expected that the BLOW-UP algorithm will perform better in LLN's
where each pair of nodes is connected by multiple fibers, resulting in
a large no. of alternate paths. </LI>
