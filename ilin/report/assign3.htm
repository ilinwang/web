<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Objective:</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>because the 2nd method can only send 1 unit once a time, which may
take too long to finsih the algorithm. </LI>

<LI>In this new method, I send 1 demand as the 1st method, and using the
concept of &quot;researving&quot; new fiber as 2nd method.t</LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Ho</B>w</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI>Send 1 demand once a time as the 1st method; Reseave the next fiber
when capacity becomes 0 as he 2nd method.</LI>

<LI>The main procedure is the combination of the 1st and 2nd method. Basically,
we send 1 demand from the largest one to the smallest one. However, if
a demand is really too large, and can't be feasible, we will have to <B>add
new fiber for all the arcs as the 1st method. </B>If it is feasible, then,
we scan for all the arcs on the assigned paths, if its capacity becomes
0 after the assignment, we will <B>researve for next fiber, and change
the capacity and cost as the 2nd method</B>. </LI>

<LI>However, this is not as easy as the 2nd method when we want to update
the network after assigning 1 demand. In the 2nd method, we can always
guarantee the feasibility because the max flow it can send will be at least
1 unit. And also, it will only occupy single path. In the 3rd method, the
result will be complicated, there may be a path with 'tree' structure.
And also, 2 paths may use some arcs together as long as the capacity is
allowed. So, how to update the nework after the assignmet will be very
complicated.</LI>

<LI>Updating Network:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Do not update the network after we finish assign that demand</LI>

<LI>If we find the demand can't be satisfied, we will add 1 fiber for all
the arcs, that is, capacity++, till we satisfy that demand</LI>

<LI>After the assignment, scan for all the arcs along the assigned paths,
<BR>
if the capacity beomces 0, we <FONT COLOR="#B22222">turn its flag ON, capacity=1,
cost+=fiber_cost <BR>
</FONT>[<FONT COLOR="#800000">Note: here for 1 arc, I at most only add
1 fiber</FONT>]<BR>
if the capacity does not become 0, we do nothing for that arc</LI>

<LI>Now, we may have to scan all the arcs whose flags just turn off<BR>
For those which correspond to the same arc in the pysical network, we will
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">only choose 1 </FONT>to change the cost to include
the new fiber fee[do not change its cost, because we already included in
last step]; and then renew all the others' cost to be their original cost
[<FONT COLOR="#A0522D">cost-=fiber_cos</FONT>t]. [<FONT COLOR="#A0522D">all
these arcs' capacity=1, flag=ON</FONT>].</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Since we can not guarantee to satisfy a large demand, we may need to
add new fiber overallly as the 1st method. Also, for the same sake, we
have to use <B><I>Simplex Algorithm</I></B> as the 1st method. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Advantages</FONT></B>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Because I include the cost of &quot;<B><I>researving</I></B>&quot;
a new fiber into this algorithm, the algorithm will not try to add a new
fiber only if adding a new fiber costs less than traversing through other
paths.Therefore, the result should be better than the 1st method.</LI>

<LI>Because I send 1 demand instead of 1 unit of demand, so, it should
be faster than the 2nd method. But the result should not be as optimal
as which of the 2nd method.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Disadvantages</FONT>:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>The way of adding new fibers when we can't satisfy a large demand is
also the disadvantage of the 1st method. </LI>

<LI>It has more complicated updating network part than the 2nd method.
Also, its result is not as optimal as the 2nd method</LI>
</UL>
