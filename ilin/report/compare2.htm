<P>For the first few stages, this method is good, because it will try to
find availabe wavelength, and won't add fiber until it really can't find
one. So, if there are 100 demands, applying this method for the first 80
demands should work well. </P>

<UL>
<LI>We include the cost of using next fiber after we send 1 unit of demands
this way will make the algorithm better for choosing the 'better' path
whose cost is less. </LI>

<LI>Since it will be always feasible to send 1 unit of demands every time.
We can use <B><I>Shortest Path algorithm</I></B> instead of Min-Cost Flow
algorithm. SP alg. will get a solution faster. However, remember that this
comes a cost that we have to apply this SP alg. much more times than the
1st method, because we can only send 1 unit at a time. </LI>

<LI>This algorithm will also tend to average the traffic. And the effect
should be better than 1st one, since it really take into consideration
about adding fiber in advance. If it choose to add fiber, it only add one
fiber on that arc, unlike adding 1 fiber for all arcs in the 1st method.

<li>Researve next new fiber cost as the 2nd method, the result should be more optimal than the 1st method
