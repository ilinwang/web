<P><B>Abstract</B>: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Introduction of Multihop Systems for WDM network. Introduction of several
network topologies such as Shuffle Net, de Bruijn Graph, Torus(MSN), Token
Grid, and Hypercube. </LI>

<LI>Also discuss some heuristics such as Flow-Based Heuristics, Delay-Based
Heuristics .they propose routing algorithms to set up calls on a circuit-switched
basis in LLN(linear lightwave network). </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<OL>
<LI>a local lightwave network can be constructed by exploiting the capabilities
of emerging optical technology, i.e., dense WDM and tunable optical transceivers.
</LI>

<LI>The system can be configured as a broadcast-and-select network in which
all of the inputs from various nodes are combined in a WDM star coupler
and the mixed optical information is broadcast to all outputs. </LI>

<LI>In general, the physical topology, instead of being a star, can be
a linear bus or a tree.Thus, given any physical network topology, the fact
that the input lasers or the output filters can be made tunable opens up
a multitude of possible virtual network configuration. </LI>

<LI>2 classes of architectures--single-hop and multihop. </LI>
</OL>

<P>(1)single hop: </P>

<UL>
<P>(a)the nodes must communicate with one another in one hop. This requires
a significant amount of dynamic coordination between the nodes. </P>

<P>(b)in order to have better efficiency, the transceivers must be very
agile(rapidly tunable). Given that the tuning ranges of current optical
transceivers are limited, and that their current tuning times are significantly
long, the challenge is to develop protocols for performing the proper transmission
coordination in an efficient fashion. </P>
</UL>

<P>(2)multi hop: </P>

<UL>
<P>(a)the channel is relatively static, and this assignment normally is
not expected to change except when a new global assignment of all transceivers
is deemed to be more beneficial. </P>

<P>(b)it's unlikely that there will be a direct path between every node
pair. So,a packet from a source to a destination may have to hop through
0 or more intermediate nodes. </P>

<LI>It's hard to say which one is better for single-hop and multi-hop.
</LI>

<LI>Transceiver tuning times play a vital role in determining the performance
and characteristics of single-hop systems, but they have little impact
on multihop systems since the multihop virtual topology is static. </LI>

<LI>2 important issues to address when we design a good multihop system:
</LI>
</UL>

<P>(a)the virtual structure chosen must be close to optimal </P>

<P>e.g., the avg hop distance between nodes must be small </P>

<P>or the avg packet delay must be minimal </P>

<P>or the max. flow on any link in the virtual structure must be minimal
</P>

<P>(b)the nodal processing complexity must be small because the high-speed
environment allows very little processing time. So, simple routing mechanisms
must be employed. </P>

<OL>
<LI>A routing-related subproblem is the buffering strategies at the intermediate
nodes. many paper advocate the use of deflection routing under which, a
packet may be intentionally misrouted, but still reach its destination
over a slightly longer (but all optical)path, instead of being (electronically)
buffered at an intermediate node. </LI>

<LI>Irregular multihop structures address the optimality criterion directly,
but the routing complexity can be large since they lack any structural
connectivity pattern. </LI>

<LI>Regular structures have simplified routing schemes, but their regularity
also constrains the set of solutions in addressing the optimality problem.
</LI>

<LI>the offered loads by the various nodes may not necessarily be symmetric.
</LI>

<LI>Regular structures generally are amenable to uniform loading patterns,
irregular structures can be optimized for arbitrary work-loads. </LI>

<LI>Finally, whether to employ dedicated or shared channels must be mindful.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>for dedicated channels, each virtual link employs a dedicated wavelength
channel. However, since internode traffic may be bursty, the traffic on
an arbitrary link is expected to be burst , too. Therefore results in some
of the links' utilizations being low. So, the shared channel mechanism
advocates the use of 2 or more virtual links to share the same channel
in order to improve the channel utilization. </P>

<P><B>Flow-Based Optimization:</B> </P>

<P>Problem: </P>

<P>N nodes, each node has T transmitters and T receivers; <BR>
Capacity of each channel is C units(b/s) <BR>
Traffic matrix {<FONT FACE="Symbol">l</FONT><SUB>sd</SUB>}, <FONT FACE="Symbol">l</FONT><SUB>sd
</SUB>is the traffic flow from s to d <BR>

C<SUB>ij</SUB>=Z<SUB>ij</SUB>C: capacity of link ij <BR>
f<SUB>ij</SUB>/C<SUB>ij</SUB> : fraction of the capacity which is utilized
on link ij </P>

<P>the max. utilization of an arbitrary topology is <IMG SRC="./gif/img00046.gif" HEIGHT=46 WIDTH=64 ALIGN=CENTER>
</P>

<P>Among various alternative topologies that are possible, the one that
minimizes the above quantity is chosen to be the optimal interconnection
pattern. </P>

<P>FWA(flow and wavelength assignment) problem can be set up as a mixed
integer optimization problem, with a min-max objective function subject
to a set of linear constraints. </P>

<P>Characteristics of this problem: </P>

<UL>
<LI>it allows the traffic matrix to scale up by the max amount before its
most heavily loaded link saturates </LI>

<LI>only need to know the node-to-node traffic intensities, the solution
is independent of the traffic type(either circuit- or packet-switched type)(either
datagram-based or virtual-circuit-based) </LI>

<LI>search space for the connectivity diagram grows rapidly with increasing
N </LI>
</UL>

<P>So, [36] proposes a suboptimal and iterative algorithm: </P>

<P>Step1: first determines a heuristic initial solution </P>

<P>Step2: then applies branch-exchange operations iteratively to improve
the solution. </P>

<UL>
<LI>In Step1,they heuristically tries to maximize the one-hop path traffic(i.e.try
to connect nodes which has more traffic in one hop)==&gt; this can be solved
by a special simplex algorithm. </LI>

<LI>Step2 is the routing problem, which can be formulated as a multicommodity
flow problem with a nonlinear, nondifferentiable, convex objective function;
and can be solved by using the flow deviation method.???[23] </LI>

<LI>Iterative improvement is performed by considering a no. of least-utilized
branches(say, K) 2 at a time. A branch-exchange operations is performed
by <BR>
(1)swapping the transmitters(or receivers) of the 2 least-utilized branches
<BR>
(2)resolving the routing problem on the new connectivity diagram <BR>
(3)accepting the swap if the new topology leads to a lower networkwide
max. link utilization. </LI>
</UL>

<P>repeat these steps until no improvement is obtained. <BR>

<HR></P>

<P><B>Delay-Based Optimization: </B></P>

<P>One of the objectives in designing an optimal virtual topology is to
minimize the mean networkwide packet delay. </P>

<LI>There are 2 kinds of packet delays </LI>

<P>(1)propagation delays encountered by the packet as it hops from the
source through intermediate nodes to the final destination <BR>
(2)queuing at the intermediate nodes </P>

<P>For a high-speed network which the channel capacity is large, the queuing
delay can be ignorable compared to the propagation delay which directly
depends on the glass distance between nodes. </P>

<P>Thus, this optimization also need to know the distance matrix {d<SUB>ij</SUB>},
is the glass distance from i to j per the underlying physical topology.??

<P><B>ShuffleNet:</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>from any tagged node in any column, note that p nodes can be reached
in 1 hop, another p*p nodes in 2 hops, and so on, until all remaining p^k-1
nodes in the 1st column are visited. call this the 1st pass. In the 2nd
pass, all nodes which were not visited in the first pass can now be visited.
</LI>

<LI>the shuffleNet structure's diameter equals 2k-1. The diameter for any
multihop structure is defined to be the ma. hop distance between any 2
nodes. </LI>

<LI>due to multihopping, only a fraction of a link's capacity actually
is being utilized for carrying direct traffic between the 2 specific nodes
connected by a link, while the remaining link capacity is used for forwarding
of multihop traffic. </LI>

<LI>Adaptive and Deflection Routing Strategies in ShuffleNet: </LI>
</OL>

<P>Objective: to ensure that packets avoid congestion or hot spots in the
network. </P>

<P>When a packet is more than k hops away from its destination in a (p,k)
ShuffleNet, the packet is routed on the outgoing link with the least no.
of queued packets. Sometimes, even if a packet is fewer than k hops away
from its destination(i.e. a single shortest path to the destination exists),
the packet may be routed to one or the remaining and least congested (p-1)
outgoing links if the no. of packets queued for the preferred link exceeds
a certain threshold, while the queue size on the least-congested link is
below a different and much smaller threshold. </P>

<OL>
<LI><B>advantages</B> of employing deflection routing in a (p,k) ShuffleNet
is that, if a packet at an intermediate node is more than p hops away from
its destination, then multiple shortest paths exist between the intermediate
node and the destination. </LI>

<LI>The intermediate node can therefore be considered a &quot;don't care&quot;
node, and all p outgoing links are equally suitable. A large network(with
a large p) has a large no. of &quot;don't care&quot; nodes for an arbitrary
path, and hence there are fewer contentions for preferred paths. </LI>
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>a ShuffleNet uses a small, fixed no. of transceivers per network access
node and provides nearly optimal throughput. (that's why it has long been
proposed as an ideal optical connectivity) </LI>

<LI>But building multihop networks using ShuffleNets requires either a
large no. of fibers or a large no. of wavelengths. </LI>

<LI>a multihop WDM network is characterized by its optical connectivity,
which is independent of the underlying fiber topology. </LI>

<LI>ShuffleNet is advocated as an ideal optical connectivity for building
high-throughput multihop lightwave networks. Because </LI>
</OL>

<P>(a)a ShuffleNet uses a small, fixed no. of transceivers per network
access node, and provides nearly optimal throughput. </P>

<P>(b)because of its symmetry and regularity, it has simple and efficient
routing schemes. </P>

<OL>
<LI>for bus and star fiber topologies, while the layouts on the fiber layer
are simple, they demand an excessive no. of wavelengths. various schemes
are proposed to avoid the problems by sharing one wavelength among multiple
optical connections. This brings a multiple access problem which results
in complexity and inefficiency, especially for bursty traffic. But, this
still needs many wavelengths. </LI>

<LI>The difficulty is embedding a ShuffleNet on other simple topologies
with optimal wavelength assignment is a very hard problem. </LI>

<LI>ShuffleNet is the multiplication of hypercube and ring. </LI>

<LI>With 7, we can embed ShuffleNet on mesh network using a small no. of
fiber buses and an even smaller no. of wavelengths </LI>

<LI>They conclude that mesh-based ShuffleNet is suited for high-speed LAN
or metropolitan-area networks and practical for implementation. </LI>

Generalized Perfect Shuffles to Multihop Lightwave Networks.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Author</B>: Michael G. Hluchyj; Mark J. Karol </FONT></P>

<OL>
<LI>They propose ShuffleNet for achieving concurrency in distributed lightwave
networks. </LI>

<LI>A ShuffleNet can be configured with each user having as few as 1 fixed-wavelength
transmitter and 1 fixed-wavelength receiver, avoiding both wavelength-agility
and pretransmission-coordination problems. </LI>

<LI>It can achieve at least 40% of the max efficiency possible with wavelength-agile
transmitters and receivers. </LI>

<LI>ShuffleNet achieves high efficiency for uniform traffic loads. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B>ShuffleNet Connectivity:</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>increasing no. of columns, k, will increase the expected no. of wavelengths
a packet must use to reach its destination in ShuffleNet. Thus, decreases
the channel efficency. </LI>

<LI>From their test in fig6, it is best to keep k=2, and increase N=kp<SUP>k</SUP>
by increasing p. However, for the shared channel ShuffleNet with a single
transmitter and single receiver per user, p is equal to the no. of users
sharing a common wavelength. Hence, increasing p decrases the max. througput
per user. </LI>

<LI>if one desires a higher user throughput without going to multiple transmitters
and receivers, or the concentration of multiple users, this can be achieved
by selecting a larger k. The decrease in channel efficiency with increasing
k is compensated by an increased no. of channels in the network. </LI>

<LI>for high-speed packet networks, delay is generally dominated by fixed
propagation delays. </LI>

<LI>k=1 row corresponds to the connectivity achieved with a single-channel
broadcast bus; p=1 column corresponds to the connectivity achieved in a
ring network. For p and k greater than 1, ShuffleNet combines the shared
channel feature of a broadcast bus with the multihop feature of a ring.
</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>ShuffleNet Routing to achive load-balanced channels</B> </P>

<OL>
<LI>They present a routing algorithm for the single-transmitter, single-receiver-per-user
ShuffleNet with shared channels. They show that algorithm delivers packets
from any give source to any given destination in the min no. of hops possible
for the source/destination pair. </LI>
</OL>

<P>the algorithm also loads all WDM channels with the same average traffic
when the distribution of source and destination addresses is uniform. </P>
