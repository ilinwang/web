<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Title: A New Model for Optimal Routing in All-Optical
Networks with Scaleable Number of Wavelength Converters</B> </FONT></P>

<P><B>Author</B>: Chien Chen; Subrata Banerjee </P>

<P><B>Purpose</B>: </P>

<OL>
<LI>propose a novel approach for modeling the optimal routing and wavelength
assignment problem in WDM all optical networks. </LI>

<LI>propose a graph model called &quot;interconnected-layered-graph&quot;
which provides an exact solution of the optimal routing and wavelength
assignment problem in wavelength convertible networks with arbitrary no.
of wavelength converters at each node. </LI>

<LI>presented a dynamic routing and wavelength assignment scheme based
on the proposed interconnected-layered-graph model. It is evaluated for
various network configurations.<BR>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><B>Problem</B>: </P>

<P>assume nodes are equipped with limited and scaleable set of wavelength
converters. They study the RAW problem with each wavelength router equipped
with a limited no. of wavelength converters shared by all the incoming
circuits. </P>

<P>Thus, at each switching node with d ports and w wavelengths per port,
the no. of converters is between 1 and d*w. (if |C|=d|W|, the model is
exactly the same as the classical circuit-switching theory, which appears
in most of the papers using wavelength converters.) <BR>
</P>

<P><B>The Network Model</B><BR>
</P>

<P>Define the network model N(R,C,A,L.W) for a given WDM optical network
<BR>
R={r<SUB>i</SUB>}: set of wavelength routers <BR>
C={c<SUB>i</SUB>}: set of wavelength converters per wavelength router <BR>
A={a<SUB>i</SUB>}: set of access nodes <BR>
L={l<SUB>i</SUB>}: set of directed optical fiber links <BR>
W={w<SUB>i</SUB>}: set of available wavelengths per link<BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>for a router r, it can rout an incoming wavelength from one of its
input port to any of its output port either directly(no converting) or
via a converter c<SUB>i</SUB>, such that no same wavelengths will be routed
to the same output port. </LI>

<LI>at each node, no. of converters |C| is assumed to be scaleable from
1 to d|W|. d is the no. of incoming physical links at that node. So, if
|C|=d|w|, the network will be equivalent to an electronic circuit switched
network. </LI>

<LI>the access nodes are directly attached to routers via optical links.
They provide electro-optical conversions for supporting electronic packet
and circuit switching operations. It may be an end-user or electronic switching
equipment. </LI>

<LI>each link in L carries |W| WDM channels. It provides connection between
a pair of routers or between an access node and a router. </LI>

<LI>Assume the physical connectivity matrix is symmetric.??? 2-way link?
</LI>

<P><B>Analytical Formulation: </B></P>

<OL>
<LI>assume set of optical connection requests, M={(a<SUB>i</SUB>,a<SUB>j</SUB>)|
a<SUB>i</SUB>,a<SUB>j</SUB> <IMG SRC="./gif/belong2.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15>A}
is known initially. Objective is to accommodate as many lightpath requests
as possible.(i.e. to minimize the blocking probability) </LI>

<LI>the interconnected-layered-graph(ILG) model allows the optimal routing
and wavelength assignment problem to be formulated as a <I>maximal multicommodity
integer flow</I> problem. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B>ILG model:</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>each node i in R is replicated |W| times, and called router nodes,
denoted as v<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>, v<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> ,v<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>
... v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> . </LI>

<LI>if link connects router i to router j, then, node v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>
is connected to node v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>j</SUB> by a directed &quot;<I>wavelength
edge</I>&quot; e<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>ij</SUB>, <IMG SRC="./gif/img00018.gif" HEIGHT=19 WIDTH=40>W.
</LI>

<LI>for each router i, 2 additional &quot;<I>converter nodes</I>&quot;
v<SUP>c</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> , v<SUP>c'</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> represents the set
of wavelength converters. they are connected by a directed edge. </LI>

<LI>converters at a node can be shared by the incoming circuits, so, we
can add directed edges, called &quot;<I>converter edges</I>&quot;, from
nodes (v<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>, v<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> ,v<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>
... v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>) to v<SUP>c</SUP>i, and from v<SUP>c'</SUP>i
back to (v<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>, v<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> ,v<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>
... v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>) </LI>

<LI>every access point can become 2 nodes: v<SUP>s</SUP><SUB>a</SUB>, v<SUP>d</SUP><SUB>a</SUB>.
directed path from v<SUP>s</SUP><SUB>a</SUB> to (v<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>,
v<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> ,v<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>i</SUB> ... v<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>i</SUB>),
and back to v<SUP>d</SUP><SUB>a</SUB> . </LI>

<LI>total no. of nodes: 2|A| + |R||W| + 2|R| </LI>

<P>2|A|: duplicated access nodes(source, destination) <BR>

<OL>
<LI>the simulation is done by randomly generating networks with different
sizes. Degrees of all the nodes(i.e. routers) are assumed to be the same
</LI>

<LI>For each configuration, the simulation results are averaged over 10
random topologies. assume the cost c(l)=1 <IMG SRC="./gif/forany.gif" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=17>
l <IMG SRC="./gif/belong2.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15> L; 6 access nodes are
attached to each router.????? requests arrive by Poisson process with mean
arrival rate r, holding times of the light paths are exponentially distributed,
with mean 1 time unit <BR>
once a lightpath is blocked, it is removed from the lightpath-request queue.
<BR>
The requests are uniformly distributed over all the access node pairs.
</LI>

<LI>when |C| increases, the blocking probability decreases. but, the improvement
is not significant beyond 8 converters. </LI>

<P><I>Network Utilization, u</I> <BR>
=(no. lightpaths established*Avg hop distance of the established lightpaths)/(no.
links*no. wavelengths per link) <BR>
=probability that given wavelength on a given link is in use????? </P>

<LI>The results show that a small no. of wavelength converters can improve
the blocking rate significantly?? </LI>
</OL>

<P>REFER TO FIG6(a)(b) and FIG7: </P>

<UL>
<LI>One thing is strange: from Fig 6(b), the utilization of wavelength
convertible network is less than that of the wavelength continuous networks
for arrival rates between 280 and 370.(i.e. we expect |C|=0 should have
less utilization, but it is just the opposite.) </LI>

<LI>Since <I>more lightpaths are established in wavelength convertible
networks</I>(i.e. less blocking), its lower utilization can only be attributed
to <I>smaller avg hop distance of the established lightpaths</I>.(from
the definition of u, they guess so.) </LI>

<LI>Use of converters does not always reduce the blocking rate.(e.g. Fig6(a)
shows when r&gt;380, |C|=0 is better than |C|=2) However, Fig6(b) shows
utilization for networks with |C|=2 is actually higher than |C|=0 when
r&gt;380.==&gt; <I>even though fewer no. of lightpath are accepted(less
utilization), more lightpaths with longer hop-distances are supported because
of the wavelength converters.</I> </LI>

<LI>A small no. of wavelength converters can significantly improve the
performance of larger networks.??? This is because <I>avg. hop distance
lightpath requests are benefited more when wavelength converters are used</I>.
</LI>

<P><B>Conclusion:</B><BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>based on the ILG model, the optimal routing of the network with scaleable
no. of wavelength converters can be formulated in more realistic way than
the existing proposals. </LI>

<LI>their model provides an exact optimal solution for a given network
with a limited no. of wavelength converters at each node. </LI>

<LI>A fast heuristic algorithm for dynamic routing is obtained under a
simplified version of the ILG model. </LI>

<LI>the results show that the performance is comparable to the one presented
in [5] but its computational complexity k is only O(|R|<SUP>2</SUP>|W|<SUP>2</SUP>)
</LI>
</OL>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><B>Comment</B>: </P>

<OL>
<LI>From their result, it's hard to draw any conclusion. They did not mention
much about how they test(e.g. what are those 10 kinds of network topologies?
how do they construct the networks? What value should we set up for a and
c(l)??) </LI>

<LI>they claim they got the &quot;exact&quot; solution, but they also said
they use a suboptimal way.?? I also don't know the relation between SILG
and ILG. Why solving SILG will solve the original problem? </LI>

<LI>what's the relationship between access nodes, router nodes, and converter
nodes?? what are they? what does the original network look like? </LI>
