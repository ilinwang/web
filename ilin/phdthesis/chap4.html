                    We have reviewed most of the shortest path algorithms in the 
                    literature in Chapter 3. Our purpose is to design new algorithms 
                    that can efficiently solve the MPSP problem. In this Chapter, 
                    we propose two new MPSP algorithms that exploit ideas from 
                    Carr&eacute;'s APSP algorithm (see Section 3.4.1.1).<br>
                    Section 4.1 introduces some definitions and basic concepts. 
                    Section 4.2 presents our first new MPSP algorithm (DLU1) and 
                    proves its correctness. Section 4.3 gives our second algorithm 
                    (DLU2) and describes why it is superior to the first one. 
                    Section 4.4 summarize our work.</p>
                  <p align="justify"><strong>Summary</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter 
                    we propose two new algorithms called DLU1 and DLU2 that are 
                    suitable for solving MPSP problems. Although their worst case 
                    complexity O(n&sup3;) is no more efficient than other algebraic 
                    APSP algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall &lt;cite&gt;Fl62, Wa62&lt;/cite&gt; 
                    and Carr&eacute;'s &lt;cite&gt;Ca69, Ca71&lt;/cite&gt; algorithms, 
                    our algorithms can, in practice, avoid significant computational 
                    work in solving MPSP problems.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    First obtaining the shortest distances from or to the last 
                    node n, algorithm DLU1(i0,j0,k0) systematically obtains shortest 
                    distances for all node pairs (s,t) such that s=k0, t=j0 or 
                    s=i0, t=k0 where k0:=min_{i}{max{s_{i},t_{i}}}. By setting 
                    i0:=1, it can be used to build the shortest path trees rooted 
                    at each node t=k0. When solving MPSP problems, this algorithm 
                    may be sensitive to the distribution of requested OD pairs 
                    and the node ordering. In particular, when the requested OD 
                    pairs are closely distributed in the right lower part of the 
                    n&times;n OD matrix, algorithm DLU1 can terminate much earlier. 
                    On the other hand, scattered OD pairs might make the algorithm 
                    less efficient, although it will still be better than other 
                    APSP algorithms. A bad node ordering may require many &quot;fill-ins.&quot; 
                    These fill-ins make the modified graph denser, which in turn 
                    will require more triple comparisons when applying our algorithms. 
                    Such difficulties may be resolved by reordering the node indices 
                    so that the requested OD pairs are grouped in a favorable 
                    distribution and/or the required number of fill-in arcs is 
                    decreased.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    Algorithm DLU2 attacks each requested OD pair individually, 
                    so it is more suitable for problems with a scattered OD distribution. 
                    It also overcomes the computational inefficiency that algorithm 
                    DLU1 has in tracing shortest paths. It is especially efficient 
                    for solving a special MPSP problem of n OD pairs (s_{i},t_{i}) 
                    that correspond to a matching. That is, each node appears 
                    exactly once in the source and sink node set but not the same 
                    time. Such an MPSP problem requires as much work as an APSP 
                    problem using most of the shortest path algorithms known nowadays, 
                    even though only n OD pairs are requested.<br>
                    Our algorithms (especially DLU2) are advantageous when only 
                    the shortest distances between some OD pairs are required. 
                    For a graph with fixed topology, or a problem with fixed requested 
                    OD pairs where shortest paths have to be repeatedly computed 
                    with different numerical values of arc lengths, our algorithms 
                    are especially beneficial since we may do a preprocessing 
                    step in the beginning to arrange a good node ordering that 
                    favors our algorithms. These problems appear often in real 
                    world applications. For example, when solving the origin-destination 
                    multicommodity network flow problem (ODMCNF) using Dantzig-Wolfe 
                    decomposition and column generation &lt;cite&gt;BaJoHaSi95&lt;/cite&gt;, 
                    we generate columns by solving sequences of shortest path 
                    problems between some fixed OD pairs where the arc cost changes 
                    in each stage but the topology and requested OD pairs are 
                    both fixed. Also, in the computation of parametric shortest 
                    paths where arc length is a linear function of some parameter, 
                    we may solve shortest distances iteratively on the same graph 
                    to determine the critical value of the parameter.</p>
                  <p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    Our algorithms can deal with graphs containing negative arc 
                    lengths and detect negative cycles as well. The algorithms 
                    save storage and computational work for problems with special 
                    structures such as undirected or acyclic graphs.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    Although we have shown the superiority of our algorithms over 
                    other algebraic APSP algorithms, it is, however, still not 
                    clear how our algorithms perform when they are compared with 
                    modern SSSP algorithms empirically. Like all other algebraic 
                    algorithms in the literature, our algorithms require O(n&sup2;) 
                    storage which makes them more suitable for dense graphs. We 
                    introduced techniques of sparse implementation that avoid 
                    nontrivial triple comparisons, but they come with the price 
                    of extra storage for the adjacency data structures.</p>

                    A more thorough computational experiment to compare the empirical 
                    efficiency of DLU1 and DLU2 with many modern SSSP and APSP 
                    algorithms is conducted in Chapter 5, in which we introduce 
                    additional sparse implementation techniques that lead to promising 
                    computational results.</p>
