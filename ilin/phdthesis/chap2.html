                    In this chapter, we try to summarize most of the solution 
                    techniques that have appeared in the literature, especially 
                    those which appeared after 1980.</p>

                    Due to the special block-angular structure of MCNF problems, 
                    many special solution methods have been suggested in the literature. 
                    Basis partitioining methods partition the basis in a way such 
                    that computing the inverse of the basis is faster. Resource-directive 
                    methods seek optimal capacity allocations for commodities. 
                    Price-directive methods try to find the optimal penalty prices 
                    (dual variables) for violations of the bundle constraints. 
                    Primal-dual methods raise the dual objective while maintaining 
                    complementary slackness conditions and will be discussed in 
                    more detail in Chapter 6. In the last two decades, many new 
                    methods such as approximation methods, interior-point methods 
                    and their parallelization have been proposed. Although the 
                    convex or integral MCNF problems are not the main interests 
                    of this dissertation, we still summarize recent progress in 
                    these topics. </p>
                  <p align="justify"><strong>Summary</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have introduced 
                    and summarized most of the methods in the literature for solving 
                    the MCNF problems. Different solution techniques may be advantageous 
                    for different MCNF problems depending on the problem characteristics. 
                    This dissertation focuses on solving the class of MCNF problems 
                    in which many OD commodities have to be routed. Therefore, 
                    the algorithms by Barnhart et al. &lt;cite&gt;BaJoHaSi95, 
                    BaHaVa96, BaHaVa00&lt;/cite&gt; seem to be most suitable for 
                    our purpose. In Chapter 6, we will propose new primal-dual 
                    column generation algorithms which follow the PD algorithmic 
                    framework. We will also exploit the ideas from the CYCLE-RELAX 
                    algorithm.</p>
                  <p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    In our algorithms (see Chapter 6), subproblems which seek 
                    shortest paths between multiple pairs must be repeatedly solved. 
                    Therefore, efficient multiple pairs shortest paths (MPSP) 
                    algorithms will speed up the overall computational efficiency 
                    of our MCNF algorithms. We introduce several shortest path 
                    algorithms in Chapter 3, give our own new MPSP algorithms 
                    in Chapter 4, and describe their computational performance 
                    in Chapter 5. We will introduce our MCNF algorithms and their 
                    computational performance in Chapter 6.</p>
