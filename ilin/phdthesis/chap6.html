                    We have briefly introduced the primal-dual methods in Section 
                    2.4 and key variable decomposition in Section 2.3.3. In this 
                    chapter, we will combine these two methods to solve MCNF problems.</p>
                  <p align="justify"><strong>Summary</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter 
                    we first discussed generic primal-dual methods (PD) for solving 
                    origin-destination multicommodity network flow (ODMCNF) problems. 
                    We proposed two methods to determine the step length theta^{*} 
                    and choose the latter one for our implementation. We perturbed 
                    the objective coefficients of the artificial variables to 
                    resolve the degenerate pivots caused by primal degeneracy.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    We then proposed a new method, the primal-dual key path method 
                    (KEY), to solve ODMCNF problems. We discussed its properties 
                    and difficulties, and proposed techniques to resolve cycling 
                    problems caused by dual degeneracy.<br>
                    We compared our algorithm KEY with other three algorithms, 
                    PD, DW, and NA. We found DW, the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition 
                    method, was the fastest algorithm in all of our tests. As 
                    expected, solving the node-arc formulation (NA) without any 
                    special techniques such as resource-directive methods or the 
                    basis-partitioning methods introduced in Chapter 2, will be 
                    time-consuming and very inefficient, except for small networks.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    KEY follows the generic PD steps but uses the key path decomposition 
                    method to solve a relaxed RPP at each iteration. It is designed 
                    for problems with large number of commodities. In our limited 
                    tests, KEY does perform better than PD for cases with more 
                    commodities. However, for larger cases with few commodities, 
                    it performs much worse than PD. The reason for its inefficiency 
                    is that it requires many iterations of key path swapping operations. 
                    Although our proposed technique, which perturbs the objective 
                    coefficients for path flows, has reduced the chances of key 
                    path swapping and resolved the cycling problem caused by dual 
                    degeneracy, it is still not efficient enough for some larger 
                    cases.<br>
                    More tests should be performed, especially using cases with 
                    a large number of commodities, to draw more solid conclusions 
                    on the efficiency of KEY.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    We also found that generating all shortest paths for the same 
                    commodity may not save time in Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition 
                    with a column generation scheme. That is, generating a single 
                    shortest path for each commodity is good enough.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    To explain why DW performs so well compared to PD and KEY, 
                    we give the following reasons:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p align="justify"> First, DW generates fewer shortest paths 
                      than DW and KEY. In particular, DW will not generate a path 
                      twice, if we keep all of the previously generated paths 
                      in the restricted master problem. PD and KEY, on the other 
                      hand, generate a new set of all shortest paths at every 
                      iteration using the new dual solutions. Note that between 
                      two primal-dual iterations, many paths may remain the shortest 
                      and do not need to be altered. The reason that we remove 
                      the entire previous set of shortest paths and add a new 
                      set of shortest paths is that keeping old paths would require 
                      bookkeeping on each specific path, which is difficult and 
                      inefficient. In particular, to check whether a path is in 
                      the current set takes exponential time when there are (exponentially) 
                      many paths to be added or removed. Furthermore, using CPLEX 
                      to solve the RPP usually requires the sparse representation 
                      of the constraint matrix. In this case, each path corresponds 
                      to a column. Removing and adding columns will require a 
                      new sparse representation. Although we can add easily columns 
                      at the end of the matrix, identifying the columns to be 
                      removed requires sparse matrix operations. Thus, PD and 
                      KEY invoke many more operations than DW does, making the 
                      algorithms less efficient.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    Degeneracy is an important issue, especially for primal-dual 
                    based methods like PD and KEY. Multiple optimal dual or primal 
                    solutions may cause implementation problems. Techniques that 
                    choose a &quot;good&quot; optimal solution are desired, and 
                    may drastically shorten the total running time.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    KEY has one more issue of concern than PD: the memory requirement. 
                    To implement the key path swapping operations more efficiently, 
                    we allocate memory to store the initial relaxed RPP at each 
                    primal-dual iteration. Inside a primal-dual iteration, KEY 
                    may perform many iterations of key path swapping. The column 
                    corresponding to the key path is empty, and an empty column 
                    has no sparse representation at all. Thus, it is clumsy to 
                    do the key path swapping and column operations only using 
                    the original sparse representation of the RPP. Although we 
                    have an efficient way to swap key paths and update each column 
                    for the commodities that have new key paths, it still requires 
                    much time, especially when there are many iterations of key 
                    path swapping operations. Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 show that 
                    more iterations of swapping key paths results in a longer 
                    running time compared to PD.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    To make KEY more competitive, new techniques that identify 
                    better dual improving directions can be developed. Our results 
                    show that efficient MPSP algorithms play a crucial role in 
                    improving all of the path-oriented multicommodity network 
                    flow algorithms, especially primal-dual based algorithms like 
                    PD and KEY which 85% (PD) or 95% (KEY) of their total running 
                    time computing shortest paths.</p></TD>
