'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been an OR graduate student in several of the best institutes for many 
    years, I have learned and observed from many excellent teachers how to prepare 
    good lectures, encourage students, design suitable homework sets and exams, 
    and adjust teaching plans based on the feedback and input from students. My 
    experience as a TA for one and half years at Georgia Tech has been beneficial 
    to me. I have helped undergraduate students in operations research, probability 
    and statistics courses. I have also given several lectures for graduate courses 
    such as airline operations research and computational optimization. To ensure 
    that my lecturing remains of good quality and in to keep up with the best 
    schools in other countries, I plan to keep checking and updating my class 
    materials by referencing on-line course materials from schools such as MIT, 
    Stanford, and Georgia Tech.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The following are the courses that I am qualified to teach:</p>
  <ul><li><b>Mathematics: 
    </b>Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, Graph Theory, Discrete 
    Math, Management Math</li></ul>
  <ul><li><b>Deterministic 
    OR:</b> Linear Programming, Nonlinear Programming, Network Optimization, Integer 
    Programming, Combinatorial Optimization</li></ul>
  <ul><li><b>Stochastic 
    OR:</b> Stochastic Process, Simulations</li></ul>
  <ul><li><b>Computations:</b> 
    C Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Computational Optimization</li></ul>
  <ul><li><b>Applications:</b> 
    Supply Chain Modeling, Logistics, Transportation and Supply Chain Systems, 
    Airline Operations Research</li></ul>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since my specialty is the creation and use of deterministic optimization techniques 
    and algorithms, I am especially qualified to teach graduate level courses 
    in the categories of Deterministic OR, Computations, and Applications as listed 
    above. To teach new courses that cover different categories as listed above 
    will also be fine with me.</p>
